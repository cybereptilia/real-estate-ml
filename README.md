# Real Estate Price Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting real estate prices based on property features. Built using Python, Scikit-Learn, and JupyterLab.

It is based on techniques taught in **Chapter 2** of the book:
*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow*
by Aurelien Geron (3rd Edition)

## Features

- Data exploration & visualization
- Feature engineering (house age, encoded variables)
- Preprocessing pipeline (imputer + scaler)
- Model training: Linear Regression, Decision  Tree, Random Forest
- Cross-Validation evaluation
- GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
- Model saving via joblib

  ## Chapter 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  In this chapter, I explored a real estate dataset using:

- 'pandas' for data wrangling
- Scikit-Learn 'Pipeline' and 'StandardScaler'
- Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressors
- Model evaluation with cross-validation (RMSE)
- Hyperparameter tuning with 'GridSearchCV'
